# Ultracite Integration Summary

## What was implemented
- Successfully integrated Ultracite v5.3.8 as a zero-config Biome preset
- Updated biome.json to extend "ultracite" configuration
- Upgraded @biomejs/biome from 2.0.6 to 2.2.2
- Added lefthook integration for git hooks (though currently commented out)
- Configured VS Code settings for Biome as default formatter
- Added AI-ready editor configurations (Claude Code, Cursor)

## Key benefits achieved
1. **Stricter code quality**: Ultracite enforces consistent type definitions (type vs interface)
2. **Better TypeScript safety**: Enhanced type checking and consistency rules
3. **AI-ready formatting**: Optimized for better code generation compatibility
4. **Zero maintenance**: No manual configuration needed going forward
5. **Performance**: Rust-based Biome engine for fast linting/formatting

## Configuration changes
- biome.json: Added `"extends": ["ultracite"]` while preserving existing project settings
- package.json: Added ultracite dependency and upgraded Biome version
- .vscode/settings.json: Updated to use Biome as default formatter for all supported file types
- lefthook.yml: Git hooks configuration (currently disabled with comments)

## Current status
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- Production build: ✅ Successful
- Linting: ~179 minor issues remaining (mostly filename conventions and style preferences)
- All core functionality working correctly

## Files automatically formatted
- Fixed 60+ files with safe auto-formatting
- Applied unsafe fixes to 49 additional files
- Converted interfaces to type aliases for consistency
- Sorted CSS classes and JSX attributes
- Self-closing elements standardized

## Next steps (optional)
- Consider renaming component files to kebab-case if desired
- Address minor magic number extractions
- Enable lefthook git hooks if pre-commit linting is wanted
- Fine-tune any specific rules in biome.json if needed
